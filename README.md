## Project Overview
Louise, an aspiring playwright, launched a Kickstarter campaign for her play *Fever* to aquire sufficient funding.  It was mostly successfully, almost reaching her goal in a short period.  Louise has contracted me to answer her questions about Kickstarter launch timing as well as how well similar projects have fared based on their monetary goals.  She would like to know more about these factors that could potentially affect the success or failure of her future campaigns.  With regard to this question, I will be taking a look at a data set of over 4000 Kickstarter projects .
### Purpose
The purpose in this analysis is to uncover any trends that relate to the success or failure of Kickstarter projects.  Specifically, theater projects will be of interest in the available data so that we can relate any findings back to Louise's goals. A sub-group of theater projects that is also of interest is plays.   Ideally, the results and consequent conclusions will help Louise make more informed decisions about her future projects.
