# **Kickstart my Heart**
![Motley](Motley.jpg)
## Project Overview
  Louise, an aspiring playwright, launched a Kickstarter campaign for her play *Fever* to aquire sufficient funding.  It was mostly successfully, almost reaching her goal in a short period.  Louise has contracted me to answer her questions about Kickstarter launch timing as well as how well similar projects have fared based on their monetary goals.  She would like to know more about these factors that could potentially affect the success or failure of her future campaigns.  With regard to this question, I will be taking a look at a data set of over 4000 Kickstarter projects .
### Purpose
  The purpose in these analyses is to uncover any trends that relate to the success or failure of Kickstarter projects.  Specifically, theater projects will be of interest in the available data so that we can relate any findings back to Louise's goals. A sub-group of theater projects that is also of interest is plays.  Ideally, the results and consequent conclusions will help Louise make more informed decisions about her future projects.
## Analysis and Challenges
  In the following analyses, tabular data describing specific attributes in my data set was used to create graphical visualizations.  The first set of tabular data is in a pivot table format, which can be dyanamically viewed to drill down to specific information.  In this analysis, campaign success was compared to the launch date.  Multiple filters were applied to the pivot table to view data for theater projects, and also to view outcomes by year rather than as a whole.  The second set of tabular data was created by hand rather than using a pivot table.  Data was retrieved for this table using the COUNTIFS function.  After creating multiple "goal amount bands", I used the COUNTIFS function to return counts of successful, failed, and canceled projects in each band.  This table was used to compare campaign success to the varying campaign goals.    
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  The chart above is a visual description of outcomes over time.  It includes data from theater projects launched between 2009 and 2017.  As can be seen in the visual, successful kickstarter projects are more common for this period of time than either failed projects or canceled projects.  Although the amount of cancelled projects stays somwhat steady over this time period, the amount of canceled projects is quite low compared to the numbers for failed and successful projects.  The canceled project outcome will not be relevant to this analysis.  Instead, it may be useful to look at the months with the most successful theater projects.  It appears that May, June, and July each have more successful theater projects than the other months in this subset of data.
