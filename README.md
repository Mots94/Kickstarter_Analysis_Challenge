# Kickstart my Heart
## Project Overview
Louise, an aspiring playwright, launched a Kickstarter campaign for her play *Fever* to aquire sufficient funding.  It was mostly successfully, almost reaching her goal in a short period.  She would like to know more about factors that could potentially affect the success or failure of future campaigns.  With regard to this question, I will be taking a look at data from Kickstarter projects similar to Louise's to aid her in answering this question.
